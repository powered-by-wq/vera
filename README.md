The implementation of ERAV provided by vera is optimized for storing and tracking changes to *time series data* as it is exchanged between disparate technical platforms (e.g. mobile devices, Excel spreadsheets, and third-party databases).  In this context, ERAV can be interpreted to mean Event-Report-Attribute-Value, as it represents a series of *events* being described by the *reports* submitted about them by various contributors in e.g. an environmental monitoring or citizen science project.

# Getting Started

```bash
pip3 install vera
```

vera is an extension to [wq.db], the database component of the [wq framework].  See <https://github.com/wq/vera> to report any issues.

# Models

The core of vera is a collection of [Django models] that describe the various components of the ERAV data model.  There are four primary models (ERAV) and three auxilary models, for a total of seven models.  The mapping from vera models to their ERAV conceptual equivalents is below:

vera model | ERAV equivalent
-----|------
**`Event`** | *Entity*
`Site` | -
**`Report`** | *Record*
`ReportStatus` | -
**`Parameter`** | *Attribute*
**`Result`** | *Value*
`EventResult` | -

The vera models are all [swappable], which means they can be subclassed and extended without breaking the foreign key relationships needed by the ERAV model.  For example, to customize the `Event` model, subclass `BaseEvent` and update your `settings.py`:

```python
# myapp/models.py
from django.db import models
from vera.models import BaseEvent

class Event(BaseEvent):
    date = models.DateTimeField()
    type = models.CharField()
```

```python
# settings.py
WQ_EVENT_MODEL = "myapp.Event"
```

Each of the seven models are described in detail below.

## `Event`

The `Event` model corresponds to the *Entity* in the ERAV data model.  `Event` represents a time series of monitoring events.  For example, each visit a volunteer makes to an observation site could be called an `Event`.  The `Event` model does not contain any metadata about the digital record describing the event.  This information is in the `Report` model, discussed below.

At a minimum, an Event instance has a `site` reference (see below) and an event `date`, which might be either a date or a full date and time, depending on project needs.  The default implementation assumes a date without time.  A custom `date` field and additional attributes can be configured by extending `BaseEvent` and swapping out `Event` via the `WQ_EVENT_MODEL` setting.  Note that if `Event` is swapped out, `EventResult` should be as well.

## `Site`

The `Site` model represents the location where an event occured.  It is not strictly a part of the original ERAV definition but is a natural extension.  In the default implementation, `Site` simply contains `latitude` and `longitude` fields.  In practice, `Site` is often swapped out for a version with [identify] support, to facilitate management of site identifiers assigned by the project or by third parties.

```python
# myapp/models.py
from django.db import models
from vera.models import BaseSite

class Site(models.IdentifiedModel, models.LocatedModel, BaseSite):
    pass
```

```python
# settings.py
WQ_SITE_MODEL = "myapp.Site"
```

All site instances have a `valid_events` property that returns all of the event instances that contain at least one valid report.

## `Report`

The `Report` model corresponds to the *Record* in the ERAV data model.  `Report` tracks the provenance metadata about the `Event`, e.g. who entered it, when it was entered, etc.  Depending on when and how data is entered, there can be multiple `Reports` describing the same event.  The status of each of these reports is tracked separately.

At a minimum, `Report` instances have an `event` attribute, a `status` attribute (see below), a `user` attribute, and an `entered` timestamp.  `user` and `entered` are set automatically when a report is created via the [REST API].  Additional attributes can be added by extending `BaseReport` and swapping out `Report` via the `WQ_REPORT_MODEL` setting.  Note that the `Report` model contains only provenance metadata and no information about the event itself - the `Event` model should contain that information.

In addition to the default manager (`objects`), `Report` also has a custom manager, `vaild_objects` that includes only reports with valid statuses.  `Report` instances have a `vals` property that can be used to retrieve (and set) a `dict` mapping of parameter names to result values (see below).

In cases where there are more than one valid report for an event, there may be an ambiguity if reports contain contradicting data.  In this case the `WQ_VALID_REPORT_ORDER` setting can be used control which reports are given priority.  The default setting is `("-entered", )`, which gives priority to the most recently entered reports.  (See the [CSCW paper](https://wq.io/research/provenance) for an in depth discussion of conflicting reports).

## `ReportStatus`
To support custom workflows, the list of report statuses is maintained as a separate model, `ReportStatus`.  `ReportStatus` instances have a short code (`slug`), a `name`, and an `is_valid` boolean indicating whether reports with that status should be considered valid.  Additional attributes can be added by extending `BaseReportStatus` and swapping out `ReportStatus` via the `WQ_REPORTSTATUS_MODEL` setting.

In a typical project, the `ReportStatus` model might contain the following instances:

slug | name | is_valid
-----|------|----------
unverified | Unverified | `False`
verified | Verified | `True`
deleted | Deleted | `False`

## `Parameter`

The `Parameter` model corresponds to the *Attribute* in the ERAV data model.  `Parameter` manages the definitions of the data "attributes" (or "characteristics", or "fields") being tracked by the project.  By keeping these definitions in a separate table, the project can adapt to new task definitions without needing a developer add columns to the database.

At a minimum, `Parameter` instances have a `name`, an `is_numeric` boolean, and a `units` definition (that usually only applies to numeric parameters).  Additional attributes can be added by extending `BaseParameter` and swapping out `Parameter` via the `WQ_PARAMETER_MODEL` setting.  For streamlined integration with other wq modules (in particular [dbio]), the `BaseParameter` class leverages the [identify] and [relate] patterns.

## `Result`

The `Result` model corresponds to the *Value* in the ERAV data model.  `Result` manages the definitions of the data attributes (or characteristics, or fields) being tracked by the project.  `Result` is effectively a many-to-many relationship linking `Report` and `Parameter` with a value: e.g. "Report #123 has a Temperature value of 15".  Note that `Result` does not link to `Event` directly - this is a core distinction of the [ERAV] model.

At a minimum, `Result` instances have a `type` (which references `Parameter`), a `report`, and `value_text` and `value_numeric` fields - usually only one of which is set for a given `Result`, depending on the `is_numeric` property of the `Parameter`.  `Result` instances also contain an `empty` property to facilitate fast filtering during analysis (see below).  Additional attributes and custom behavior can be added by extending `BaseResult` and swapping out `Result` via the `WQ_RESULT_MODEL` setting.  Note that if `Result` is swapped out, `EventResult` should be as well.

`Result` instances have a settable `value` attribute which is internally mapped to the `value_text` or `value_numeric` properties depending on the `Parameter`.  `Result` instances also have an `is_empty(val)` method which is used to set the `empty` property.  The default implementation counts `None`, empty strings, and strings containing only whitespace as empty.

## `EventResult`

The `EventResult` model is a [denormalized] table containing data from the "active" results for all valid events.  A valid event is simply an event with at least one report with an `is_valid` `ReportStatus`.  To determine which results are active:

 1. First, all of the results are collected from all of the valid reports for each event.  Only non-empty results are included.
 2. Next, results are grouped by parameter.  There can only be one active result per parameter.
 3. Within each parameter group, the results are sorted by `Report`, using the `WQ_VALID_REPORT_ORDER` setting.  The first result in each group is the "active" result for that group.

(This is not exactly how the algorithm is implemented, but gives an idea of how it works)

In the simple case, where there is only one valid `Report` for an event, all of the `Result` instances from that `Report` will be counted as active.  In more complex situations, some `Result` instances might be occluded.

Since this algorithm can be computationally expensive, the results are stored in the `EventResult` model for fast retrieval.  The `EventResult` model should never be modified directly, as it is updated automatically whenever an `Event`, `Report`, or `Result` is updated.

The `EventResult` model contains an `event` attribute, a `result` attribute, and all of the fields from both `Event` and `Result` (prefixed with the source model name).  The full set of fields for the default `EventResult` model is `event`, `result`, `event_site`, `event_date`, `result_type`, `result_report`, `result_value_numeric`, `result_value_text`, and `result_empty`.

Whenever `Event` or `Result` are swapped out, `EventResult` should be swapped as well.  The `create_eventresult_model()` function can be used to generate an `EventResult` class without needing to manually duplicate all of the field definitions.

```python
# myapp/models.py
from django.db import models
from vera.models import BaseEvent, Result

class Event(BaseEvent):
    date = models.DateTimeField()
    type = models.CharField()
    
EventResult = create_eventresult_model(Event, Result)
```

```python
# settings.py
WQ_EVENT_MODEL = "myapp.Event"
WQ_EVENTRESULT_MODEL = "myapp.EventResult"
```

vera ships with an [EventResultSerializer] and views that leverage [Django REST Pandas]' charting serializers.  This makes it possible to quickly generate d3.js charts from the `EventResult` table via [wq/chart.js] and [wq/pandas.js].
